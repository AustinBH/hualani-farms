          We maintain a personal commitment to a carbon neutral 100% sustainable
          farm model Our farm is completely "off the grid". We obtain all our
          power from the vibrant Maui sunshine, water from the pure and
          nourishing Hﾄ］a rain, allowing us to sustainably grow and harvest
          citrus, spices, vegetables, and herbs in some of the richest volcanic
          soil available on the planet.
