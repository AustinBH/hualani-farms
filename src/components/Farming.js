        Nurtured by the gentle, tropical HƒÅna rain, refreshed by the gentle
        ocean breeze, and warmed by the Maui sunshine, Hualani Farms produces
        all of its tropical fruit, spices, and plants using environmentally
        intelligent processes to ensure not only a beautiful harvest today, but
        a healthy and sustainable yield well into the future.
