        Nurtured by the gentle, tropical HƒÅna rain, refreshed by the gentle
        ocean breeze, and warmed by the Maui sunshine, Hualani Farms produces
        all of its tropical fruit, spices, and plants using environmentally
        intelligent processes to ensure not only a beatiful harvest today, but a
        healthy and sustainable yield well into the future

        The future of food is about the soil, about community, nutrition,
        wildlife, education, and collaboration.

        Every plant grown on our farm is grown and nurtured with love and
        respect for the aina ("land").
